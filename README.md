🎯 Guess the Number Game
A fun and interactive Guess the Number Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range and gets feedback on each guess — too high, too low, or correct!

🕹️ Features
🎲 Random number generation every round

🔢 User input for guessing the number

💬 Real-time feedback on guess (too high, too low, correct)

🔁 Reset button to play again

✅ Simple UI with clean styling

🧪 Technologies Used
HTML – Game structure

CSS – Styling and layout

JavaScript – Game logic and interactivity

🚀 How It Works
A random number is generated between 1 and 100 (or any custom range).

The user enters a number in the input field and clicks "Check".

The program compares the guess to the secret number and shows:

“📈 Too high!” if the guess is greater

“📉 Too low!” if the guess is smaller

“🎉 Correct Number!” if the guess is right

A "Play Again" button resets the game with a new number.
